declared Event :  not a component, cannot be seen, dont't exist in window directly, affects window

declared Component :  a node with it's own script



declared Primitive <Abstract> : cannot be seen, only by inheriting can it

declared Test <Real> : to review how a primitive component adapts

declared Object <virtual> : not a component but controls components



declared day <Step> : a whole day assignment

declared create (tence) : List of components created or to be created that day, based on "tence"
